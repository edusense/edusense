3,86375,Computational Perception,theory,"In this course, we will first cover the biological and psychological foundational knowledge of biological perceptual systems, and then apply computational thinking to investigate the principles and mechanisms underlying natural perception. The course will focus on vision this year, but will also touch upon other sensory modalities. You will learn how to reason scientifically and computationally about problems and issues in perception, how to extract the essential computational properties of those abstract ideas, and finally how to convert these into explicit mathematical models and computational algorithms. Topics include perceptual representation and inference, perceptual organization, perceptual constancy, object recognition, learning and scene analysis. Prerequisites: First year college calculus, some basic knowledge of linear algebra and probability and some programming experience are desirable."

5,9105,Introduction to Modern Chemistry I,theory,"This course first investigates the establishment of some fundamental principles of chemistry and then progresses through the presentation of chemically interesting applications and sophisticated problems. It explores an understanding of matter and the energy changes associated with it, beginning with the atom. It then overviews how atoms interact and react to form the more complicated structures of molecules and ionic compounds. How the structure of elements and compounds affects their properties, function, and reactivity will then be explored. Finally, the quantification of the changes during the reactivity of substances through bond breaking and forming will be investigated in single and multiple phase reactions, such as acid-base and redox reactions. Topics will be presented to promote mastery of depth over breadth of topics and conceptual understanding before using applicable equations. The course covers the major principles of atomic structure, chemical bonding, , molecular structures of organic and inorganic compounds (including some transition metal complexes), interaction of substances, multiphase reaction stoichiometry, acid-base reactions, and redox reactions. Relevant examples will be drawn from such areas as environmental, materials, and biological chemistry."

7,5391,Designing Human Centered Software,applied,"Why are things so hard to use these days? Why doesnt this thing I just bought work? Why is this web site so hard to use? These are frustrations that we have all faced from systems not designed with people in mind. The question this course will focus on is: how can we design human-centered systems that people find useful and usable? This course is a broad introduction to designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces. If you take only one course in Human-Computer Interaction, this is the course for you. We will cover theory as well as practical application of ideas from Human-Computer Interaction. Coursework includes lectures, class discussion, homework, class presentations, and group projects. This class is open to all undergrads and grad students, with either technical or non-technical majors. However, there is a programming prerequisite."
8,5410,User-Centered Research and Evaluation,theory,"This course provides an overview and introduction to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). It introduces students to tools, techniques, and sources of information about HCI and provides a systematic approach to design. The course increases awareness of good and bad design through observation of existing technology and teaches the basic skills of generative and evaluative research methods. This is a companion course to courses in visual design (51-422) and software implementation (05-430, 05-431). When registering for this course, undergraduate students are automatically placed the wait list. Students will be then moved into the class, based on if they are in the BHCI second major and year in school e.g. seniors, juniors, etc In the Fall, this course is NOT open to students outside the HCI major. The Spring offering is open to all students. This course is a core requirement for students in the HCI additional major."

The course will be organized in modules addressing particular topics including overview of methods, cognitive task analysis, qualitative methods, protocol and discourse analysis, and data mining and log analysis. A key goal is to help students think about and learn how to apply these methods to their own research programs. To enroll you must have taken 85-738, Educational Goals, Instruction, and Assessment or get the permission of the instruction."
11,5772,Social Perspectives in HCI,theory,"One of a series of four, seminar style mini-courses, to expose our PhD students to the breadth of classic and cutting edge research in four distinct traditions in HCII: computer science, cognitive science, social science, and design. Although no project is required for this course, there will be significant reading and writing. The four courses are: 05-772 Social Perspectives in HCI, 05-773 Computer Science Perspectives in HCI, 05-774 Cognitive Science Perspectives in HCI, 05-775 Design Perspectives in HCI. These are required courses for HCII PhD students."
12,17356,Software Engineering for Startups,,"Startup engineering is critical to innovation. The skills required to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms to local mid-size companies to internal startups from multi-national tech giants. However, developing software in a startup environment poses unique engineering challenges. These challenges include making and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions despite extreme uncertainty; rapidly prototyping and evaluating new ideas and features, while building minimum viable products; prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained environments; and communicating effectively both within a small engineering team and with internal and external non-technical stakeholders. This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from experienced, practicing startup engineers. This is an engineering-focused course; no entrepreneurship background is required or expected. Students do not need to have a startup idea to participate fully. Prerequisites: 17-214 OR 15-213"
13,5418,Design Educational Games,applied,"The potential of digital games to improve education is enormous. However, it is a significant challenge to create a game that is both fun and educational. In this course, students will learn to meet this challenge by combining processes and principles from game design and instructional design. Students will also learn to evaluate their games for fun, learning, and the integration of the two. They will be guided by the EDGE framework for the analysis and design educational games. The course will involve a significant hands-on portion, in which students learn a design process to create educational games digital or non-digital. They will also read about existing educational games and discuss game design, instructional design, learning and transfer, and the educational effectiveness of digital games. They will analyze an educational game and present their analysi"
14,17346,DevOps and Continuous Integration,applied,"DevOps: Engineering for Deployment and Operations: DevOps is the term given to a modern movement to establish practices that significantly reduce the time to production of committed code. This time involves deployment - the period between the completion of the code by the developers and the placing of the code into normal production and dealing with operations issues. Deployment time can be days, weeks, or even months when using normal development practices. Operational issues such as dealing with incidents and errors introduce other delays. Modern internet companies deploy a system multiple or even dozens of times every day. Achieving this velocity requires coordinated process and design activities together with supporting tooling. This course will cover the deployment process and the associated tooling, it will highlight reasons why release schedules can be slow, and it will introduce the practices that are used to enable high velocity deployments. It will also cover the kinds of problems that are created because of high velocity and how modern internet companies deal with these problems. Please note: This is a required course for MSE-SS students. Students outside of the software engineering department may take this course but students of the MSE programs will have first priority."
