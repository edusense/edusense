There are many different types of addiction; this course will focus on molecular addictions, specifically those involving members of the opiate class of narcotics. The ongoing epidemic of opiate addiction, arising both from over-prescription of pain killers and recreational use of heroin, has been widely reported and continues to rise at alarming rates, ravaging our urban and rural communities. In this course, we will explore the complicated role of chemistry in this epidemic, including the good (elucidating mechanisms of action, development of clinically useful and safe opiates and non-opiate pain killers) and the bad (design and synthesis of increasingly addictive opiates). We will also discuss ethical questions faced by the pharmaceutical industry that develops, markets and sells opiates, the medical community that prescribes opiates, and the government agencies charged with regulating these activities. Students who complete this course will emerge with a broad understanding and perspective on an issue that is of great scientific and societal importance. 3 hrs. lec.",5,4.75,5,5,5,4.88,5,5,4.88

Cars, aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms to control CPSs is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding.

The skills required to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms to local mid-size companies to internal startups from multi-national tech giants. However, developing software in a startup environment poses unique engineering challenges. These challenges include making and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions despite extreme uncertainty; rapidly prototyping and evaluating new ideas and features, while building minimum viable products; prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained environments; and communicating effectively both within a small engineering team and with internal and external non-technical stakeholders. This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from experienced, practicing startup engineers. This is an engineering-focused course; no entrepreneurship background is required or expected. Students do not need to have a startup idea to participate fully.

The goal of this course is to raise questions basic to the study of culture and social relationships in a multitude of contexts. We will also discuss the anthropologists relationship to the people s/he studies, and the responsibilities inherent in that relationship. The readings have been chosen to focus on topics that have long captured anthropologists attention and that continue to be intensely debated: social inequality, race, colonialism, body, kinship, gender, history and memory, social lives of things, globalization, and global migration. These themes reveal the diversity of human practices and experiences across time and space. The format of the course will be a combination of lectures and discussions centered around the assigned readings and visual material. Through written work, readings, films, and in-class discussion, we will examine how anthropology makes us more aware of our own culturally-ingrained assumptions, while broadening our understanding of human experiences.",4.61,4.11,4.44,4.17,4.72,4.56,4.78,4.56,4.28
